# Doraemo - AI Companion Chat Application

Doraemo is an intelligent, emotionally aware AI companion built on AWS infrastructure. It provides users with an intimate, personalized chat experience that learns from document uploads and maintains conversational context through advanced embedding-based retrieval.

## Overview

Doraemo is a full-stack application that combines modern React frontend with powerful AWS backend services to create an AI companion with personality, memory, and document understanding capabilities. The AI is designed to be emotionally intelligent, warm, and deeply engaging - more like talking to a close friend than a typical chatbot.

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + AWS Amplify)
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite build system and TypeScript
- **Authentication**: AWS Amplify Authenticator with Google OAuth
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Font Awesome icons
- **Styling**: CSS modules with responsive design

### Backend Infrastructure
- **API**: AWS AppSync GraphQL API
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito User Pools
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB for chat history and metadata
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for document storage
- **AI/ML**: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) + Amazon Titan Embeddings
- **Vector Search**: LanceDB hosted on S3
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda functions for chat processing and document embedding

### Data Flow
1. **User uploads document** ‚Üí S3 storage ‚Üí Lambda processes ‚Üí Creates embeddings ‚Üí Stores in LanceDB
2. **User sends message** ‚Üí Lambda retrieves relevant documents ‚Üí Enriches prompt with context ‚Üí Calls Bedrock ‚Üí Returns AI response
3. **Chat history** ‚Üí Stored in DynamoDB ‚Üí Retrieved for conversation context

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS account with Bedrock access enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd doraemo-web/doraemo-web-amplify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment secrets**
   - Configure Google OAuth credentials in AWS Secrets Manager:
     - `google-client-id`
     - `google-client-secret`

4. **Deploy the backend**
   ```bash
   npx amplify sandbox
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
